# wireviz

repo for some [Wireviz](https://github.com/formatc1702/WireViz) templates I've assembled. Wireviz is really neat.

### [serial](serial/): RS-232/485/422 and other UART-y cables
- [cisco-to-null](serial/cisco-to-null/): turn a USB-to-Cisco-Console cable into a null modem cable with an RJ45F-DB9F adapter


### [ethernet](ethernet/): it's ethernet! :O
- [dual-100bt](ethernet/dual-100bt/): run two 10/100 connections through a single CAT5/6/7 cable


### [rbs](rbs/): Ericsson RBS cellular equipment related stuff
- [rd-y-splitter](rbs/rd4442/): Y-splitter cable for Dual-Band Radio Dot 4442 (it's really two Dots in one box)
